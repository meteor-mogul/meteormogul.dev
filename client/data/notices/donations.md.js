# Contributing to Meteor Mogul

Last update: March 17, 2018

## Contributing Code

This is a hobby project so no formal procedure for pulling code.

I recommend that you create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) for yourself so you can use their tools to manage your code contributions.

I'm still learning GitHub's system myself, but I think this is the basic idea:

1. Fork a [repo](https://github.com/meteor-mogul/meteormogul.dev) so you have your own private copy.
2. Add whatever code you want.
3. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/meteor-mogul/meteormogul.dev/pulls).

## Contributing Money

I should be so lucky!

I'm not set up to accept money for Meteor Mogul, but if you find Meteor Mogul helpful, I encourage you to support Vue or Vuetify and tell them I sent you.

- Donate to [support Vue](https://vuejs.org/support-vuejs/)
- Donate to [support Vuetify](https://www.patreon.com/vuetify)

Thanks!
