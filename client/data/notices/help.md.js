I'd love some help figuring out the following:

- breadcrumbs
- how to convince Meteor to build a static site bundle of an app so we can build a useful static site generator in Meteor Mogul
- sorting out the options for something like Simple Schema and Autoform to work with Vue
- learning more about the process of going from a CSV upload to a nice set of charts, like Google Data Studio

Thanks!
