Here are my specific recommendations for your development environment.

# MacOS or Linux

You will save lots of time and heartache developing on a MacOS or linux machine, and not trying to code on Microsoft Windows.

Meteor builds a lot more slowly under Windows.  Plus you'll have all the fun of missing Unix utilities and CRLF line ending weirdness.

If you can't afford a Mac, get an old PC and put a version of linux on it.

# Chrome Browser

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) just works.

I really tried hard to like [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/).  But on both MacOS and Windows I have too many odd glitches with it.

While I recommend developing with Chrome, I also recommend occasionally firing up Firefox and Safari on MacOS and Edge on Windows just to see how your app looks on those browsers.  And of course it's fun to look at your apps on your cell phone and a tablet to check responsiveness.

# Programming Editor

I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).

# Source Control

Get [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage commits without having to remember \`git\` shell commands.

# Meteor

Once you have the above, you're good to go to get [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and start coding.

Once you're rockin' with \`meteor\`, you'll use it to keep everything updated, including all of the Atmosphere and npm packages you want to play with.
