# meteormogul.dev Mission

## Mission of this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to show how to build a static SPA using Meteor Mogul.

## Mission of Overall Project

The mission of Meteor Mogul is to help you learn Meteor, VueJS and Vuetify so you can create personal apps for friends and family and demo apps for partners and potential investors.

My main motivation is to learn by doing, and help others do the same. I have been toying with Meteor over the years and noticed that VueJS is taking off, so I wanted to play around with it, too. The pedagogical philosophy here is that you’ll be able to learn (or to refresh your memory if you have to step away from your coding hobby for life or work reasons) best by playing around on your own with commented code examples rather than reading documentation, watching videos, attending a conference, or sitting in a lecture hall.

VueJS enhances the Meteor developer experience with a view layer that is extremely intuitive and easy to use, while also being cleverly designed to allow you to tackle more sophisticated projects as your skill grows. It’s a better Blaze: more people are working on VueJS right now, and VueJS benefits from the years of development of other view layers, adopting good ideas while remaining easy to learn.

The final piece to building web apps is style, to make your apps look good. Of the many style frameworks available, Vuetify has a great set of features for people learning to develop web apps.

Meteor Mogul combines Meteor, VueJS and Vuetify into a platform that makes it easier to write web apps that work on modern evergreen browsers.
